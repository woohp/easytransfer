EasyTransfer is to easily send one program to another person.

easytransfer <file_to_send>

It will run a HTTP server in the background, and give you a link for the file.
The link, by default, expires in 1 hour or 3 downloads, whicheve comes first.
Directories are supported:
easytransfer <folder_to_send>
The folder will automatically be compressed before being sent.

This program will automatically forward ports using UPnP. If you are behind
a router without UPnP, it will probably not work.

So far, it is only tested on Mac OS X, but full support for Windows and Linux is coming.

This program requires the boost, libarchive, and miniupnpc. It also
depends on mongoose, but a slightly modified version is included with
the source code. The make system is based on scons. If you have scons
installed, you can compile it by typing 'scons' in the folder.

This program is released under the BSD license.
