EasyTransfer is to easily send one program to another person.

easytransfer <file_to_send>

It will run a HTTP server in the background, and give you a link for the file.
The link, by default, expires in 1 hour or 3 downloads, whicheve comes first.
Directories are supported:
easytransfer <folder_to_send>
The folder will automatically be compressed before being sent.

This program will automatically forward ports using UPnP. If you are behind
a router without UPnP, it will probably not work.

So far, it is only tested on Mac OS X, but full support for Windows and Linux is coming.
